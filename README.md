# sf6-timeshifts-from-rigby2010
Calculate timeshifts of the SF6 mixing ratio timeseries at the tropical ground to different entry regions. Using data from the file RIGBY_SF6_MOLE_FRACTIONS_1970_2008.nc, which is a NetCDF file containing annual mean optimized three-dimensional mole fractions output from MOZART for 1970 - 2008, published in Rigby et al. 2010; doi:10.5194/acp-10-10305-2010

Details on the scientific background of this analysis can be found in the publication "Mean age from observations in the lowermost stratosphere" submitted to ACP in 2022 by Thomas Wagenhaeuser et al.
